      <p>
        When a user makes an aggregate lifetime total of deposits exceeding EUR
        2000 or requests a withdrawal of any amount inside the
        https://Betzhub.com platform, then it is compulsory for them to perform a
        full KYC process.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        During this process, the user will have to input some basic details
        about themselves and then upload
      </p>
      <div className="mb-6">
        <ol start="1" className="list-decimal list-inside">
          <li>
            A copy of Government Issued Photo ID (in some cases front and back
            depending on the document)
          </li>
          <li>A selfie of themselves holding the ID document</li>
          <li>A bank statement/Utility Bill</li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <p>
          Once uploaded, the user will get a “Temporarily Approved” Status and
          the documents will now be on our side, and the “KYC Team” will have
          24hrs to go over them and email the user about the outcome:
